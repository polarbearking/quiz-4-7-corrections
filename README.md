# Quiz 4-7 corrections


## Quiz 4

#### Question 7
Null and undefined are valid data types and integer is not. Undefined and null are valid in javascript while interger is not.

#### Question 8
const PI = 3.14; is the right answer. The reason this is right and my answer was wrong is because for constants the names should be in all caps.

#### Question 9
let x = 27; is also a correct answer. This is correct because it is possible to declare a value and set its value in the same line.

#### Qustion 11
```
1. Write a function called payingTheBill that does the following:

Prompts the user to enter his or her favorite restaurant, saving the response in an appropriately named variable.
Prompts the user to enter the number of guests he or she would like to invite to go out to dinner at the aforementioned restaurant, saving the response in an appropriately named variable.
Prompts the user to enter the total cost of that dinner (i.e., the bill), saving the response in an appropriately named variable.
Generates the HTML to display the message in the following format: "Dinner at X doesn't come cheap! Everyone owes $Y!"
X should be the restaurant the user entered in the first prompt.
Y should be the total bill entered in the third prompt divided by the number of guests entered in the second prompt (plus yourself!).
You may assume that the HTML and JavaScript files are correctly linked, the button and its onclick attribute are configured, the HTML element where you'll be displaying the message has an id of pay-the-bill, and that the user will enter values of the expected data types (i.e., a string for the first prompt, and numbers for the second and third).
```
